# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 Hi, my name is Oscie, and I make things, do things, make more things and do more things! But seriously, hey! I like to do lots of things, from chatting, to playing games to developing random stuff (I guess I'm normal then, huh). I have a website (shown below) and a Discord bot. I am a Translator and Tester for WiiLink24 and like to play games on the Wii such as Wii Sports, Beat the Beat: Rhythm Paradise and even more stuff. I'm usually chill, and won't shove a pen down your throat if you don't agree with me lol. I usually struggle to find things fun, but there are a couple things. I am attemting to learn Japanese currently, and am really terrible at it lmfao. I have no clue on what else to write, so I'll leave it at that. Thanks for reading this and have a great day, whether its the start or end!
